# ICSI 404 Coursework
The goal of the course was to design a simplified CPU Emulator that can handle a custom architecture of Assembly. The components of the project included a Longword, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Memory, Computer.

The instructions that are supported in this build:
- Arithmetic and Logic Operations
  - add/sub
  - logical shift left/right and arithmetic right shift
- Halt (HLT)
- Interrupt (INT)
- Move (MOV)
- Jump (JMP)
- Compare (CMP) - Not yet implemented
- Branch (Bxx)  - Not yet implemented
  - if equal (BEQ)
  - if not equal (BNE)
  - if less than (BLT)
  - if less than equal (BLE)
