# ICSI 404 Coursework
The goal of the course was to design a simplified CPU Emulator that can handle and execute an architecture of Assembly. The components of the project included a Longword, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Memory, Computer.

The instructions that are supported in this build:
- Arithmetic and Logic Operations
  - add/sub
  - logical left/right shift and arithmetic right shift
- Halt (HLT)
- Interrupt (INT)
- Move (MOV)
- Jump (JMP)
- Compare (CMP)
- Branch (Bxx)
  - if equal (BEQ)
  - if not equal (BNE)
  - if less than (BLT)
  - if less than or equal (BLE)
